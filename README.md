# sqlserver-dba-utilities
A curated set of T-SQL scripts I’ve developed and used in real SQL Server production environments for administration and troubleshooting.

This toolkit includes:
	•	Performance tuning scripts (execution stats, waits, missing indexes, expensive queries)
	•	Database health checks (DBCC, file growth, fragmentation, storage analysis)
	•	Blocking & deadlock detection
	•	Backup & restore helpers
	•	User/session monitoring
	•	Log file & tempdb diagnostics
	•	Automation utilities for daily DBA tasks

All scripts are written with clarity and SQL Server best practices. Suitable for MSSQL versions 2012–2022.
